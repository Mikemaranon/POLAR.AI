# POLAR.AI: the open-source AI ecosystem

![POLAR.AI Logo](/assets/POLAR.AI-t-small.png)

`POLAR.AI` is a project to develop an `open-source ecosystem` fully capable of **designing**, **creating**, **training** and **deploying** artificial inteligent models in on-premise and cloud infrastructures.  
The ecosystem has 3 main software components:

| Component        | Description                                                                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **POLAR Studio** | `Main user-side component` responsible for keeping all ecosystem components connected. Its primary functionality is `managing the entire user domain` with their respective permissions. |
| **POLAR Core**   | Module for `creating models` based on **neural networks** or **foundational models**. Its functionality includes providing services for `creation, training, and fine-tuning` for various scenarios, either with **base models or from scratch**. |
| **POLAR Node**   | Module where the created models are executed to be used in real-world cases. It serves as the `deployment environment` for models and is designed to support `cluster architecture` to serve multiple models simultaneously. |
## Project Description

This project aims to be completely free and open-source. It is not a commercial venture offering services. The POLAR ecosystem is being developed to be released and published, allowing any user or company to use it at no cost.  
POLAR is being designed to be compatible with both cloud and on-premise architectures, making it adaptable to any environment.
